# Small-Scale-Testbed-CARE-PV
In the folder of "CARE-PV -> Small scale test system -> New Test System", we provide four folders and a pdf document. 

The pdf document "37-bus test system" describes the overall information of the small-scale testbed for validation purpose. The team should run proposed algorithms according to the information provided in this document.

In the subfolder "codes", we provide the OpenDss and Matlab codes for power flow calculation of the 559-bus system. The system parameters for OpenDss are provides in the .dss file (559node.dss). And the Matlab code for running OpenDss is given in "OpendssLoadflow.m". Matlab file "New_IEEE37_lins_impedance.m" provides the impedance matrix for the 37-node system. 

Subfolders of "Hourly data", "Minute data", and "Second data" provide load profiles in different resolutions for a variety of research purposes. These data are obtained based on e-Gauge street.
